## Overview

### Description

- Project Gutenberg is a publicly available, free-to-use digital library that offers eBooks free of cost. This is the worldâ€™s oldest ebook store with regular updates. All of the Project Gutenberg metadata is collected together and made available as an XML file which is regularly updated by their team with changes to the content (number of books, actual information about each book, etc.) and the schema of each book object.
- Each ebook record contains several fields like: Title, Digital Release Date, Description, Reading Score, Authors, Language, Subjects, etc.
- We collect the **XML data**, verify it against an **XML schema**, transform it using **XQuery**, insert it into a **Postgres** database and serve it via an **HTML interface**.

### Access Phase Output (Research Questions)

We answer three questions to get insight into the books data that was **collected** and **prepared**:

1. What are some books related to a particular subject (like Drama, History, Love, etc.): This is a search made across languages to offer the user a list of books related to a specific theme.
2. What are the top 10 easiest to read books from a particular language?: The user chooses a language from a number of languages made available as a drop-down menu and the easiest to read books (sorted according to Reading Ease Score) are shown to him/her. `pycountry` is used to derive the language names from their codes stored in the database.
3. Search for books by author name: The user can input a particular author name to view the books written by that author.

**NOTE**: The actual database queries and the ER diagram can be found inside the `docs` folder. To fit the results of each query on a computer screen we only render a subset of the entries for the first and third question.

## Steps to run the Collect-Prepare-Access phases

### Collect

1. Unzip the file **pgmarc.zip** inside the `resources/xml` folder and place the contained file in a location of your choice (preferrably inside the same folder `resources/xml` for convenience).

**Note**: We downloaded the original file "pgmarc.xml" from Project Gutenberg's official feeds [page](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/) as mentioned on their [official page](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html#:~:text=very%20user%2Dfriendly.-,The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20Catalog%20Metadata%20in%20Machine%2DReadable%20Format,-XML/RDF/CSV), fully abiding to their [usage policy](https://www.gutenberg.org/policy/robot_access.html). This file is regularly updated by their team and these updates also involve schema changes which would require corresponding changes to the program. Hence, for practial purposes, the file we used while developing this project (mid-June) has been added in the `resources/xml` folder. 

### Prepare

**NOTE**: If using a Windows system, when entering the paths, use a `\\` instead of a `\` for folder separations e.g. "C:`\\`Vedant`\\`Uni`\\`Subjects`\\`TT`\\`markup-maverics`\\`src" instead of "C:\Vedant\Uni\Subjects\TT\markup-maverics\src" 

1. Ensure you have placed the pgmarc.xml file in a place you know.
2. Ensure you have all python dependencies installed:
    - Change directory to `src/`
    - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Edit `src/extract_valid_objects.py` and set the values of: 
    - `XML_PATH`: Absolute path of pgmarc.xml on your local system.
    - `XSD_PATH`: Absolute path of `resources/record_schema.xsd` on your local system.
    - `OUTPUT_PATH`: Absolute path of the output file (including the name of the file and .xml extension e.g. "path/extractedObjects.xml") on your local system that will store results of this program.
4. Edit `src/transform_valid_objects.py` and set the values of:
    - `INPUT_FILE`: Same as the `OUTPUT_PATH` from the previous step.
    - `OUTPUT_FILE`: Absolute path of the output file (including the name of the file and .xml extension e.g. "path/transformedObjects.xml") on your local system that will store results of this program.
5. Edit `src/database_populator/create_schema.py` and set the values of:
    - `dbConfig['password']`: Enter password of your local PostgreSQL setup.
    - Change other fields in the `dbConfig` object if you must to get access to the user 'postgres' inside PostgreSQL server.
6. Edit `src/database_populator/write_records.py` and set the values of:
    - `dbConfig['password']`: Enter password of your local PostgreSQL setup.
    - `DATA_FILE_PATH`: Same as the value of `OUTPUT_FILE` from step 4.
7. Don't change anything else to ensure the program works correctly.
8. Run all 4 Python scripts in **this order**:
    - `python src/extract_valid_objects.py`
    - `python src/transform_valid_objects.py`
    - `python src/database_populator/create_schema.py`
    - `python src/database_populator/write_records.py`
9. After this all of the data should be in your postgres server inside the database called `gutenberg_metadata`. To verify, simply connect to the database using your console or pgadmin, and run `select count(*) from records;`, this should show you a non-zero value (typically more than 25000) which would confirm successful data insertion.

### Access

1. Edit `src/flask-app/app.py`:
    - Add your postgres password for the value inside psycopg2.connect() function call (line 11).
2. Run `python src/flask_app/app.py` to start the Flask server.
3. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
4. All data is served through this HTML interface.
